# Project: Feed Reader Testing 

## Overview

Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree project.

### Task

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

### Technologies Used

* [Jasmine - 2.4.1](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/releases)
* Node.js
  * Npm
* JavaScript
  * [handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/)
  * jQuery
  * HTML5
  * CSS3


## Project Instructions

To view the code and make changes:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Download the repository to your computer.
3. Locate the `index.html` file and open with an internet browser or favorite editor.

(Optional) A web server is not required to view the application, however  you wish to test with a local web server use the following node package http web server
Instructions (For local web server)

1. Install  node.js (npm will install as part of this installation)
2. Install http-server with the following command:

    `npm install http-server -g`

    This will install http-server globally so that it may be run from the command line.
3. run http-server in terminal inside the root of the cloned repo with the following command:

    `http-server`

4. Visit http://localhost:8080 to view the application
